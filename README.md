# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection and Classification

## Overview

This repository contains a Flask web application for the detection, classification, and segmentation of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) images. The application processes retinal images to determine the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, providing critical information for early diagnosis and treatment.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload retinal images in standard formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
- **Detection and Classification**: The application analyzes the uploaded images to detect and classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy.
- **Segmentation**: The application segments the regions of interest in the retinal images to highlight affected areas.
- **Results Visualization**: The results of detection, classification, and segmentation are displayed on the web interface.
- **API Access**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for integrating the detection and classification functionalities into other applications.
